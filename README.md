I really have to learn to start these readme's at the very beginning to organize my thoughts better.

*ahem* well, It can't be helped now.

This is my spin on the "Defeat the Evil Wizard" turn based RPG project.
She's filled out, functional,
has more than a few absolutely BUSTED balance issues that I have either left in or outright enabled for nothing more than the sheer comedy and love of the game

this is a simple game with a command line interface, but my is she a cute little thing. Due to certain balance issues, she's definitely a short play.
Theres one simple easter egg that kicks in under very specific circumstances that I am proud of, it SHOULDN'T get me sued since it's a not for profit and not for sale project.
But, who knows, litigious society and all that.
